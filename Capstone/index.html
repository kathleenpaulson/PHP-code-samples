        <p>
                Pages is a small independent bookstore and cafe with a cozy feeling that encourages you
                to put up your feet and stay a while.  We are furnished with comfortable sofas and chairs 
                and all the free coffee you can drink.  We sell new and used books, magazines, comic books, 
                and hard-to-find first editions.  We are a Long Island institution, a community hangout, 
                and an experience you can't download.

        <h2 class = "darkgreen">Why Shop At An Independent Bookstore?</h2>
        <p>
                Here's a few great reasons: tax dollars stay local, we bring authors to town and plan fun events, 
                and we are a great place to meet new people at our book clubs!  We get to know you and can offer customized book selections.
